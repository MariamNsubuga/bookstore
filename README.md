# About the  Bookstore Management System Project

1. With this project, it will be very easy to manage all the records in a bookstore. 
2. All the customers can buy books from the books list visible to them and also are able to request for a book which is not available in the books list. 
3. The admin of the bookstore can add new books or delete a book from the list. 
4. The admin can also see all the requested books by the customers and try to make them available. Lastly, the admin can see all the customers listed with their orders.


The objective of the project is to implement a bookstore management system where users can buy books and also can request for a book if that particular book is not available in the table displayed to the users. The admin should be able to manage the entire system. Basic knowledge of the front-end part and a good knowledge of Django is required to complete and understand the project.
